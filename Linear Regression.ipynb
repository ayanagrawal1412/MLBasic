Together the arithmetic means of x and y coordinates is in fact the coordinates of the point where both the sums ie of squares of x differences and that of squares of y differences are minimum.

        "Most popular library for Linear Algebra ie for doing maths on vectors and matrices. Vectors represented as 1d arrays and Matrices as 2d arrays, while NumPy supports higher dimensioned arrays as well. Total number of dimensions (also called **axes** in NumPy terminology) is called the **rank** of the NumPy array. A 2d np array can be thought of as an array of (m) arrays each of which in turn contains (n) scalars. And, we say (m,n) is the **shape** (which is basically a tuple in Python) of this 2d array. Rank here is 2. Thus len of shape is rank. And m is the 1st axis and n is the last axis. When such an np array is printed, it's shown as a grid of m rows and n columns.\n",

        "Quite elegant functionality of NumPy arrays. Helps to do arithmetic between arrays of different shapes. A simple arithmetic like addition or multiplication of 1 np array with another object should require the other object also to be an np array of exactly same shape because arithmetic is done element wise between these np arrays. But broadcasting relaxes this constraint and expands (think of it as by copying) the axis of length 1 in 1 array to match the size of the corresponding axis in the 2<sup>nd</sup> array or adds more axes in the smaller of the 2 arrays or even scalars so that we get 2 arrays having the same number of axes and with same lengths giving us the same number of elements in both arrays to facilitate the element-wise arithmetic.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Also for a pair of dimensions to be compatible they either have to be same or 1 of those 2 need to be 1.\\\n",
